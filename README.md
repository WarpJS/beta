# WarpJS/beta

The purpose of this repo is to collect the issues for the WarpJS serverless beta releases: both for feature requests and issues. Any contribution is one step towards an easier serverless world for JavaScript developers!

Please refer to [warp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/warp) npm module for a WarpJS introduction, setup instructions and documentation.
